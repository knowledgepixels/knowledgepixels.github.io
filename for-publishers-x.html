<h3>In a nutshell</h3>
<p>
Nanodash is a web tool that provides a novel way of sharing scientific knowledge, which is complementary to traditional scientific papers. Authors can easily publish single findings in a format that enables precise citation, automatic aggregation, and faster dissemination. Nanodash is delivered as a lightweight Software-as-a-Service and connects to an open knowledge platform. It integrates seamlessly with your existing systems, as well as with a global network.

<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>
The underlying technology, called nanopublication, is a new but proven format that is simpler, faster, and more precise than traditional publication. It is AI-compliant, FAIR by design, both human-readable and machine-interpretable, and serves three main purposes:
</p>

<p>
(1) straightforward semantic publishing of scientific statements;
</p>

<p>
(2) open annotation and reviews; and
</p>

<p>
(3) seamless linking between platforms and research domains.
</p>

<p>
Nanopublication is not only a format, but also a platform. For the technically-minded: Nanopublications are interconnected knowledge graph snippets with rich provenance, represented in RDF and published in an open, decentralized, and reliable server network that easily connects to other platforms such as Wikidata and Crossref. 
</p>

<p>
Nanopublication may be a new format for many people, but it's not rocket science. It's just an innovative combination of well-established web standards. And it’s also not that new: The concept of nanopublication dates back to 2009. Since then, the format has evolved, and several generations of applications and services have been built around it.
