<h3>Philipp von Essen</h3>
<p>
Philipp always found the idea of machines and humans meeting halfway when they communicate fascinating.
When he learned about nanopublication, he was immediately excited by its possibilities. His drive and optimism were the initial spark for founding Knowledge Pixels.
Philipp is also passionate about organizations, how they operate and develop work cultures, how they grow and evolve, and how these processes can be fostered and guided.
He has a master’s in business administration from the University of Zurich, and brings deep expertise from his previous work in a wide variety of industries.
Among other positions, he was production coordinator at Condor Films, a team leader at a cultural center, and a management assistant at IBM.
He served as a customer service manager and most recently as the head of finance at Republik during the Swiss online magazine’s start-up phase.
At Knowledge Pixels, he focused on business development and marketing, as well as handling financial and legal matters.
