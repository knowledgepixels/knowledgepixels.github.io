<h3>FAQ</h3>

<p>
Do I need to be a programmer to apply?
</p>
<ul>
<li>You don't need to be a programmer, but you should be comfortable of doing technical work, such as defining templates in Nanodash and formally modeling knowledge</li>
</ul>

<p>
Can I apply as a group or as an organization?
</p>
<ul>
<li>
We ask you to apply as individual. You can have others helping you and your organization be named and involved, but we need a single contact point as applicant and throughout the project.
<strong>Update:</strong> We are now also accepting duo projects, with two individuals applying.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
How long do incubator projects run?
</p>
<ul>
<li>Incubator projects have a default life span of six months, but they can terminate early and extensions are possible too</li>
</ul>

<p>
Do you have a question that is not listed here?

<h3 id="incubator1">#1: FAIR Vocabularies for Chemical Risk Assessment</h3 id="incubator1">

<p><em>by Gertjan Bisschop, <a href="https://vito.be" target="_blank">VITO</a></em></p>

<p>
As part of the PARC (Partnership for the Assessment of Risks from Chemicals) consortium, we are developing a FAIR data platform that will help assess the health impact of chemicals.
A crucial component of this platform is the management of vocabularies.
Since the platform is intended to support ongoing and evolving research from institutes across Europe, we consider dynamic, community-driven vocabulary management to be essential.
We believe that nanopublications offer a strong foundation for achieving this goal.
Our initial focus will be on the vocabularies associated with the Personal Exposure and Health domain, with the aim of extending this approach to other domains within PARC, encouraging the reuse of the workflows and pipelines we develop.

<h3 id="incubator2">#2: nanopublication-Enhanced Open Science Communication (nEOSC)</h3>

<p><em>by <a href="https://www.fiz-karlsruhe.de/de/bereiche/lebenslauf-und-publikationen-dr-daniel-mietchen" target="_blank">Daniel Mietchen</a>, FIZ Karlsruhe</em></p>

<p>
This project uses nanopublications to enhance the sharing of scientific information in a machine-readable fashion and around the research cycle.
It tackles practical needs like formally acknowledging contributors, pointing out issues such as broken DOIs, and documenting the state of dynamically changing resources.

<h3 id="incubator3">#3: Integrating DCAT-compliant nanopublications and EHDS-metadata </h3>

<p><em>by Margreet Bloemers, <a href="https://www.zonmw.nl/" target="_blank">ZonMw</a></em></p>

<p>
In this incubator project, we will develop an approach for an integrated analysis of metadata collected with two different, DCAT-AP compliant metadata systems:
(1) nanopublication templates of the FAIR Funding Framework (FFF) and (2) the metadata scheme that forms the basis for the National Health Metadata Catalogue (under development in the Netherlands) with metadata on datasets that are available for secondary use.
The National Catalogue is a mandatory implementation for the European Health Data Space (EHDS) in each EU-member state.

The FFF provides a uniform approach for funders and research organisations aiming to collect reusable (FAIR) information for tracking research outputs and funder activities,
using nanopublication-based metadata on components of the (1) funderâ€™s grant procedures, (2) research lifecycles, and (3) tools and services used in research domains.

The project aims to deliver a scalable approach for creating rich, machine-actionable information on projects, datasets and other outputs.
The approach must facilitate dataset-related metadata to get exposed on the EHDS-National Catalogue. This information can be supplemented with project-related information from FFF nanopublications.
